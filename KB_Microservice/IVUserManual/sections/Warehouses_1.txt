Inventory


Create purchase orders and process them, or receive in 
the inventory
as it comes through the door.
IntraVet
has a flexible inventory management system: 
The more you put into it, the more 
information and automation you get out of it.


Inventory Setup


There are 
warehouses
(if
you have multiple branches or inventory
locations), 
Vendor
Codes
, 
Unit 
Type Codes
and 
Individual Code
setups for your inventory items to put in pla
ce before fully 
utilizing the inventory module.


Warehouses


If you have separate physical branches for your practice, a main distribution center, a pharmacy or 
a storage area for which you want to be able to separately track inventory
, you
can set up separate 
warehouses
. 
For the same code, you can then track different quantities 
on
-
hand
, reorder levels, 
markup percentages and costs. 


To keep each warehouse’s information accurate, users need to pick the correct warehouse t
o both 
receive/return goods into and 
take goods out of, by invoicing
or in
-
house use.


If you would like separate prices per branch and would like 
IntraVet
to help maintain a certain 
markup percentage as costs increase, you must have a one
-
to
-
one branch/war
ehouse setup.
