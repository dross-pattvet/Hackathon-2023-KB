completely removed from their original account. 
T
he second account is 
inactivated
and still exists, but the patient
(
s
)
no longer belong to that account
after the accounts 
have been combined. 


Combining acco
unts 
a
ffects the accounts in several ways: 


 Pati
ents with the same names are combined into one 
patient
. 
 The medical history of each patient is tr
ansferred to the account to be kept
. 
 History and recalls for pets with the same name in both accounts are checked, 
corrected
,
and updated. 
 Financial transa
ctions are combined
. I
f the second account has a balance, the 
balance transfers to the first account.
