pulls all items for the vendor that 
are 
below the reorder level as well as all items that are below the reorder level with no 
Vendor attached.


 AutoL
oad
–
IntraVet uses the primary vendor for a code if there is one, or the last 
vendor if there is no primary vendor set up. When there is neith
er a primary code 
nor a last vendor, you are prompted to select one.

item). 
 Units
–
E
nter the number of Units as you purchase them from the vendor, e.g., 10 
(bottles). 
 # per Unit
–
E
nter the number in each unit as the 
practice
sells or uses them, e.g., 
150 (pills). Leave it at 1 if it is something like bags of dog food 
that 
are
sold to the 
clients in the same unit 
as
is purchased from the vendor. 
 Q
ty
(Quantity) 
–
T
he quantity as the 
practice

,
etc.
). 
It is calculated automatically (Units x # per Unit
=
Qty).
 Unit Cost
–
Enter 
if known
(sometimes you do not know until the items are 
received). The 
Unit Cost
is how much the vendor charges per Unit as the vendor 
sells it. IntraVet calculates your cost per unit for you based on the # per Unit that 
you enter. 
 The 
Total Cost
is calculated 
as the Units x Unit Cost.


If your mouse has a scroll wheel, use the wheel to increase or decrease a price/qty when
