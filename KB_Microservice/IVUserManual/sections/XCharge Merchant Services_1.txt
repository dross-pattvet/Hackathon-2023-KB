Merchant Services
software processes credit 
and
debit card transactions. 
Sales, voids, 
and returns are processed and approved through 
IntraVet
by
dipping or
swiping a card 
through a 
card 
reader 
that is 
connected to the workstation. 
This eliminates the need to process a tr
ansaction 
through a separate credit card reader and then again through 
IntraVet
.
