Statements


You can print statements for clients with balances, calculate billing and monthly interest 
percentages, and apply these charges to clients with balances that are de
signated to receive such 
charges. 


Each client entered into your system is assigned four billing
variables that affect statements: 


 Billing Fee
 Interest
 Statement Type
(Summary, Detail or None)
 Terms of COD, 30, 60, or 90 days. 


Each statement is generated according to the parameters in each client’s record (
s
ee Client Setup
)
.


When preparing to pr
int statements, certain decisions m
ust be made whether or not to:


 P
rint 
Statement
Messages. 
 S
end
a
statement
to
a
client with less than a certain balance. 
 C
harge billing fees and monthly interest percentages to clients already set up 
for these charges. 
 You can charge billing fees only to past due accounts or to charge only the 
greater of the two: monthly interest or billing fee.
 Charge the greater of the billing fee and interest. 
o IntraV
et will automatically charge both billing fee and interest if the 
ab
ove is not selected. 


 S
end statements to all clients or to clients with certain classification codes.
