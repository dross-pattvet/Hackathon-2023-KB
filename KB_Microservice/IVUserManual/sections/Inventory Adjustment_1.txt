Inventory Adjustment


In general, you should rarely have to adjust items because there are other tools in place to 
accurately receive and deplete your stock as needed. 
Inventory adjustments allow you to do three 
things: 


 D
eplete inventory
, in case 
a portion is unusable,
 E
nter an amount after doi
ng a physical inventory count,
and 
 C
ontrol lot management
(t
he allocation of a quantity to a specific expiration date
)
.


Deplete Inventory


Reduce the inventory 
item by whatever number you deplete. 
For example, if you drop an item or 
an item has expired you can de
p
lete 
the quantity on hand
. 
The number that you deplete by is 
always as used or sold by the 
practice
. 
In
-
house use or returns to the vendor may be a mo
re 
accurate way to deplete your stock.
Invoicing items out to clients automatically depletes the 
quantity 
on
