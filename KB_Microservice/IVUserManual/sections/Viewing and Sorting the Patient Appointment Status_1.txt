the 
Patient Appointment Status


The
Control Center defaults to Patient
order
, but you can 
select
the heading of any
column to sort 
it by that column
. 
If you click
a column heading 
the sort changes to descending or
ascending
order. 


Regardless of the sort order, the entr
y that is scheduled closest to 
the current time is highlighted
as a reference point.


As you hover the mouse pointer over each entry, additional information about the client, patient 
and appointment appears in a
Tooltip box.

the 
Reason

Reason

select
the filter button in 
the upper right corner (looks like a push pin). 
 Then, select a choice (Limping) from the list. Entries not matching the selected filter 
will disappear from view. 
 Select
the filter button again and select 
All
