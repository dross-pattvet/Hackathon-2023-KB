Appointment Group
Setup


After setting up type codes, providers and templates, you can easily put together 
groups/calendars for your practice. 
Each gro
up is a separate calendar and a separate window.
Keep this in mind when deciding if you should have separate groups for Surgery, Grooming, or 
other departments of your practice. 
Even if you have separate groups, all appointments made for 
the same branch 
appear together in the Control Center
where you view the day’s activity and track 
patient progress.
