Control Center 
Setup & Customization


The Control Center, also known as the white board, is the hub of communication in IntraVet. It 
allows you to get to many differe
nt places within the software from one central location. It 
provides an overview of what is going on in the practice for that day.


The top of the screen has three different tabs that switch from different places within the Control 
Center. This simplifies
access to other areas of the software. When you enter the Control Center it 
always defaults to the Control Center tab.


 Select
the Control Center icon 
in the 
IntraVet
T
oo
lbar to open the Control Center 
or select 
File | Control Center
.


The screen wil
l open to the main Cont
r
ol Center tab.


To adjust the length of a section, hold the mouse button down on the four dots between and pull 
the bar up or push it down to obtain more viewing space in the column. For example, to see more 
of the 
Patient Status 
options, pull its bar over the top of the calendar.


An entry is made in the Control Center for each patient that has activity for the day: usually an 
appointment, treatment in h
ospital or a drop

off.
