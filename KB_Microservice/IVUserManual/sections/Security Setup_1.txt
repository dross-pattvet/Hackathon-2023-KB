The access levels
are used to protect certain functions 
within IntraVet
. These 
levels
may be 
assigned to each Operator to quickly associate certain 
functions
with a certain 
job type

all kennel 
staff, for example. You 
can set up as many roles as your practice needs, but some common roles 
include Owner (with access to everything), Practice Manager, Doctor, Technician, Inventory 
Manager and Receptionist.
