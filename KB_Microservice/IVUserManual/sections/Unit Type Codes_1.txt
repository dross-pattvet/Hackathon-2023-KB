Unit Type Codes


When you are receiving inventory
, it is helpful to indicate how an item is package
d/sold by the 
vendor (bottles) versus how the 
practice
sells or uses it (pills).
As you receive each individual item, 
you can describe the unit as purchased (case for foods) and as sold by you to your clients (can). 
This association is remembered when yo
u pull up the item for each subsequent order.
