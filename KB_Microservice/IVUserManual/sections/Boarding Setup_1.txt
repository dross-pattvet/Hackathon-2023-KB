defaults 
to

. 




<<NEW PAGE 38>>


If there are
multiple branches, create an e
ntry for each branch before 
select
ing the
defaults.


 From the
IntraVet
Men
u Bar, select 
Setup | Program | General Branch Setup. 


 From the Branch List screen, highlight the Branch and select the 
Edit
button at the 
bottom of the screen, or 
double
-
click
the Branch.


Select
Boarding
Setup.


If 
you have
multiple branches
, 
eithe
r apply the defaults to all
branch locations or establish 
different defaults for specific locations. 
Determine the easies
t and fastest way to set up
your 
multiple branches.


For example, 
you may have
six branches
, but their de
faults are different.
Perhaps
two 
branches
have 
ABC
boarding defaults
; three branches have LMN defaults, and one branch has XYZ defaults.
Depending on the number of boarding differences 
between the 
branch
es
, 
instead of opening the 
LMN and XYZ branches se
parately, 
it might be easiest to open any branch, set the defaults and 
select 
Copy to All Branches
and 
OK
to save
. 
Then, open 
a
branch that is different
;
set its defaults 
and choose 
OK
, but DO NOT 
select
Copy to All Branches
again
.


Some key options that 
y
ou should consider
when setting up boarding are:


 Do you want to charge ext
ra for early or late check
-
in/
-
out times? 
 Do you want to allow overbooking or split reservations
? 
 Do you want a boarding charge to be sent autom
atically to the invoice?
 Default

] 
time
–
Default times appear on all new reservations but can 
be edited as needed.
 Add extra days for early check
-
in or late check
-
out
–
Extra days are determined according 
to the time listed in 
the cut
-
off time field
.
Although they take up an extra cage (before or 
after reservation dates), the reservation check
-
in and check
-
out dates will remain the dates 
listed.
When ch

 Enable overbooking with confirmation
–

available.
If checked, 
it is
advised
that no cages are ava
ilable and asked if an 
overbook
ing 
is wanted
.
If overbooked, the reservation window sho
ws a negative number in red for that 
cage type
availability
.
 Enable split reservations
–
Use this option when the requested cage type is not available 
for each day of the reservation. 
The 
board
er
can be relocated to other cages for part of the 
stay. 
There will be a prompt to split the reservation since
that
cage
is
not available 
for the 
duration of the stay
.
 It is recommended that you enter cage types from largest to smallest.




 After reservation
save, show confirmation number
–
If checked, a unique number for that 
reservation is displayed
. T
he confirmation number shows up on several boarding reports 
and on the Existing Reservation Window, whether or not they 
have this option checked
. 
We recommend providing
the client wit
h a confirmation number so 
there is less chance of 
an error occurring at check
-
in
,
and to provide a 
quick
method to locate the 
boarder 
in the 
system
.
 Print patient picture
on forms and cage tag
–
Including a 
boarder 
(patient) 
photo is a 
beneficial safety feature to ensure that the correct 
boarder 
is removed 
from 
and returned 
to its cage 
or moved to a different cage type
and 
accurately 
recorded on daily cage check 
log books.

saving the reservation
