quantity as well as automatically adjusting markup percentages. 


 Sell
Price
–
Enter selling price per unit for the item. 
 Dispensing Fee
–
Enter 
the dispensing fee for the item

This amount can be added to 
whatever the per unit or pill price adds up to in order to defray the cost of dispensing 
(the label, pill count, etc.).
 M
inimum Charge
–
Enter 
the minimum charge for the item
. 
Set a minimum so that this 
code 
will not be invoiced
for less than a certain amount, no matter how many are sold. 
Thi
s can be applied alone or in conjunction with the dispensing fee.
 Current Markup %
–
Calculates the current markup between the cost and the base 
selling price. It changes wh
en the cost or price changes to accurately show your 
current markup.

multiple branches or warehouses
and do not have a one
-
to
-
one relationship between 
them.
a. 
If there are multiple warehouses for one branch, they each could have different 
costs for
the same code. This means the markups would be different for each 
warehouse. There will still be a prompt when costs change; IntraVet cannot 
assume what markup to apply.
 Item Cost 
–
The base cost of the code as you sell or use it (by pill, CC, can).
 Est
imate Ranges Minimum and Maximum Price
–
If you often create estimates
from 
scratch rather than using pre
-
defined estimate templates, you can specify a default 
price range for a 
code. If defined, whenever the code is used in an estimate, 
Minimum 
Price
and 
Maximum Price
ranges
appear.
 Quantity Pricin
g
–
Instead of having multiple codes for an item because you give price 
breaks for buying more, use quantity pricing to set the price breaks on the same code. 
You can define up to 3 quantit
y price break levels. If a bottle of 100 is sold, make the 
price per pill 20 cents instead of 24 cents, for example. 
 Use disp
.
fee and min. charge for all price levels
–
Check if you would like the same 
dispensing fee and minimums to apply to your quantity pricing levels.
a. 
Many of these individual pricing choices (dispensing fees, minimums, keep 
markup) can be mass changed by departme
nt or for all inventory codes
in the 
Utilities
section of IntraVet. If most codes in a certain department should be set 
up the same, use these utilities to quickly change all of them. Then, go back 
and adjust the ex
ceptions one by one.
 Apply Settings to All Branches
–
If checked, this will apply all the settings to all 
branches. Or click the down
-
arrow to select the branch to be updated.
