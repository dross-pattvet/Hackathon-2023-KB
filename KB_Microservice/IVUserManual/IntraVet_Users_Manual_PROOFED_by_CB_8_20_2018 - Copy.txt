r apply the defaults to all
branch locations or establish 
different defaults for specific locations. 
Determine the easies
t and fastest way to set up
your 
multiple branches.


For example, 
you may have
six branches
, but their de
faults are different.
Perhaps
two 
branches
have 
ABC
boarding defaults
; three branches have LMN defaults, and one branch has XYZ defaults.
Depending on the number of boarding differences 
between the 
branch
es
, 
instead of opening the 
LMN and XYZ branches se
parately, 
it might be easiest to open any branch, set the defaults and 
select 
Copy to All Branches
and 
OK
to save
. 
Then, open 
a
branch that is different
;
set its defaults 
and choose 
OK
, but DO NOT 
select
Copy to All Branches
again
.


Some key options that 
y
ou should consider
when setting up boarding are:


 Do you want to charge ext
ra for early or late check
-
in/
-
out times? 
 Do you want to allow overbooking or split reservations
? 
 Do you want a boarding charge to be sent autom
atically to the invoice?
 Default
[
check
-
in
, 
check
-
out
] 
time
–
Default times appear on all new reservations but can 
be edited as needed.
 Add extra days for early check
-
in or late check
-
out
–
Extra days are determined according 
to the time listed in 
the cut
-
off time field
.
Although they take up an extra cage (before or 
after reservation dates), the reservation check
-
in and check
-
out dates will remain the dates 
listed.
When ch
ecked
, 
this activates the cut
-
off check
-
in and check
-
out time.
Use either the 
up
-
or 
down
-
arrow
to select a time, or 
e
nter
your
choice.
 Cut
-
off
[
check
-
in
, 
check
-

] 
time
–
Any check
-
in time before the check
-
in cut
-
off 
time 
charges an extra day
. C
heck
-
out times after the check
-
out cut
-
off time charges an extra 
day
. U
se either the up
-
or 
down
-
arrow
to select a time, or 
e
nter
your
choice
.
 Enable overbooking with confirmation
–
You may know
hi
storically how many 
cancellations
or no
-
show
s you will have
, so 
more cages 
can 
be 
reserve
d
than are actually 



available.
If checked, 
it is
advised
that no cages are ava
ilable and asked if an 
overbook
ing 
is wanted
.
If overbooked, the reservation window sho
ws a negative number in red for that 
cage type
availability
.
 Enable split reservations
–
Use this option when the requested cage type is not available 
for each day of the reservation. 
The 
board
er
can be relocated to other cages for part of the 
stay. 
There will be a prompt to split the reservation since
that
cage
is
not available 
for the 
duration of the stay
.
 It is recommended that you enter cage types from largest to smallest.




 After reservation
save, show confirmation number
–
If checked, a unique number for that 
reservation is displayed
. T
he confirmation number shows up on several boarding reports 
and on the Existing Reservation Window, whether or not they 
have this option checked
. 
We recommend providing
the client wit
h a confirmation number so 
there is less chance of 
an error occurring at check
-
in
,
and to provide a 
quick
method to locate the 
boarder 
in the 
system
.
 Print patient picture
on forms and cage tag
–
Including a 
boarder 
(patient) 
photo is a 
beneficial safety feature to ensure that the correct 
boarder 
is removed 
from 
and returned 
to its cage 
or moved to a different cage type
and 
accurately 
recorded on daily cage check 
log books.
 After 
saving the reservation
, activate
client action screen for deposit entry
–
For a quick, 
smooth workflow
,
access the deposit entry screen without leaving t
he reservation form
. 
The Client Account Management
window opens, 
so
you can add 
a deposit or check 
client/patient information after a reservation is saved
.
 Print release form
after check
-
in
–
Some 
practices 
provide the check
-
in information to the 
client for reference
,
and to store in the 
boarder’s 
hardcopy file
, if one is used
. If this box is 
checked it activates the option to Select a release form and the number of copies.
 Select release form
–
A 
release form includes: Client/Patient information, check
-
in/
-
out 
dates and times, cage number, instructions, services, patient notes, 
patient picture 
(if the 
box above is checked to print patient picture on forms) 
a boarding 
estimate
, 
a 
services 
esti
mate
, standard text and total estimate amount
. M
ost facilities use
multiple release 
forms
.
To select the form, use the down
-
arrow
.
 Number of copies
–
The default is 
zero (0) copies
.
Enter 
the 
desired number. 
Some 
practices
print 
two
copies: one for the
client to take home and the other 
to store in
the 
patient (boarder’s) hardcopy file.
 Print cage tag
after check
-
in
–
Printing the cage tag at check
-
in saves searching to locate 
the account 
later
. 
The tag shows the boarder’s name
/information, check
-
in/
-
out dates, 
cage type
, cage number, instructions, patient notes and the boarder’s pictur
e
.
 Print check
-
out form
–
It is customary to provide the client with the 
boarder’s 
ge
neral 
information, instructions, 
services, tasks and activities provided to the 
boarder 
and 
any 
reminder notices.
 Remove tasks from cage tag 
–
Any tasks entered for a boarding reservation will not print 
on the cage tag
.



 Remove tasks from Release Form 
–
Any
tasks entered for a boarding reservation will not 
print on the
release form.


 


Boarding
Surcharge


Including a surcharge in a reservation fee is typically done when the boarder is staying over a 
holiday or weekend, 
for example
. S
ome 
practices

holiday falls on a weekend
. 
IntraVet

Price Update
: Pricing Information


Pricing Information
allows you to adjust the selling price of this inventory code
by single units and 
quantity as well as automatically adjusting markup percentages. 


 Sell
Price
–
Enter selling price per unit for the item. 
 Dispensing Fee
–
Enter 
the dispensing fee for the item
. 
This amount can be added to 
whatever the per unit or pill price adds up to in order to defray the cost of dispensing 
(the label, pill count, etc.).
 M
inimum Charge
–
Enter 
the minimum charge for the item
. 
Set a minimum so that this 
code 
will not be invoiced
for less than a certain amount, no matter how many are sold. 
Thi
s can be applied alone or in conjunction with the dispensing fee.
 Current Markup %
–
Calculates the current markup between the cost and the base 
selling price. It changes wh
en the cost or price changes to accurately show your 
current markup.
a. 
New
b. 
Existing


 K
eep Markup %
–
when checked, if cost changes, markup % automatically adjusts. 
Why is Markup Disa
bled? 
This option (
Keep Markup
) can be disabled if you have 



multiple branches or warehouses
and do not have a one
-
to
-
one relationship between 
them.
a. 
If there are multiple warehouses for one branch, they each could have different 
costs for
the same code. This means the markups would be different for each 
warehouse. There will still be a prompt when costs change; IntraVet cannot 
assume what markup to apply.
 Item Cost 
–
The base cost of the code as you sell or use it (by pill, CC, can).
 Est
imate Ranges Minimum and Maximum Price
–
If you often create estimates
from 
scratch rather than using pre
-
defined estimate templates, you can specify a default 
price range for a 
code. If defined, whenever the code is used in an estimate, 
Minimum 
Price
and 
Maximum Price
ranges
appear.
 Quantity Pricin
g
–
Instead of having multiple codes for an item because you give price 
breaks for buying more, use quantity pricing to set the price breaks on the same code. 
You can define up to 3 quantit
y price break levels. If a bottle of 100 is sold, make the 
price per pill 20 cents instead of 24 cents, for example. 
 Use disp
.
fee and min. charge for all price levels
–
Check if you would like the same 
dispensing fee and minimums to apply to your quantity pricing levels.
a. 
Many of these individual pricing choices (dispensing fees, minimums, keep 
markup) can be mass changed by departme
nt or for all inventory codes
in the 
Utilities
section of IntraVet. If most codes in a certain department should be set 
up the same, use these utilities to quickly change all of them. Then, go back 
and adjust the ex
ceptions one by one.
 Apply Settings to All Branches
–
If checked, this will apply all the settings to all 
branches. Or click the down
-
arrow to select the branch to be updated.

Inventory


Create purchase orders and process them, or receive in 
the inventory
as it comes through the door.
IntraVet
has a flexible inventory management system: 
The more you put into it, the more 
information and automation you get out of it.


Inventory Setup


There are 
warehouses
(if
you have multiple branches or inventory
locations), 
Vendor
Codes
, 
Unit 
Type Codes
and 
Individual Code
setups for your inventory items to put in pla
ce before fully 
utilizing the inventory module.


Warehouses


If you have separate physical branches for your practice, a main distribution center, a pharmacy or 
a storage area for which you want to be able to separately track inventory
, you
can set up separate 
warehouses
. 
For the same code, you can then track different quantities 
on
-
hand
, reorder levels, 
markup percentages and costs. 


To keep each warehouse’s information accurate, users need to pick the correct warehouse t
o both 
receive/return goods into and 
take goods out of, by invoicing
or in
-
house use.


If you would like separate prices per branch and would like 
IntraVet
to help maintain a certain 
markup percentage as costs increase, you must have a one
-
to
-
one branch/war
ehouse setup.

Inventory Adjustment


In general, you should rarely have to adjust items because there are other tools in place to 
accurately receive and deplete your stock as needed. 
Inventory adjustments allow you to do three 
things: 


 D
eplete inventory
, in case 
a portion is unusable,
 E
nter an amount after doi
ng a physical inventory count,
and 
 C
ontrol lot management
(t
he allocation of a quantity to a specific expiration date
)
.


Deplete Inventory


Reduce the inventory 
item by whatever number you deplete. 
For example, if you drop an item or 
an item has expired you can de
p
lete 
the quantity on hand
. 
The number that you deplete by is 
always as used or sold by the 
practice
. 
In
-
house use or returns to the vendor may be a mo
re 
accurate way to deplete your stock.
Invoicing items out to clients automatically depletes the 
quantity

Splitting an Invoice


The caretaker client who is not a financially responsible partner does not owe a
ny money for 
services provided
. H
owever, the patient’s medical records are kept under this account name and 
the invoice details can be displayed/reprinted from this client’s account. 


When an invoice is saved for a patient with multiple owners, 
IntraVet
:



 C
reates a credit adjustment of the same amount to cancel out the charges in full
. T
his 
credit transaction is called a Split Invoice
Adjustment. 
 D
istributes the invoice amount amongst the partner/owners according to the 
estab
lished partnership percentages
. T
hese charges are recorded in their accounts as 
debit transactions with the animal’s name as the transaction description. 


If the client is also a partner/owner rather than a caretaker client, there will be three transactio
ns 
to handle the invoice and split invoicing:


 T
he invoice itself,
 A credit to cancel out the full charges of the invoice, and 
 A debit transaction for the amount that the owner actually owes according to the 
partner percentage. 


Deletions and Split Invoici
ng 
Deleting a Debit/Credit


Debit or credit transactions resulting from split invoicing cannot be deleted individually
. T
he 
invoice on the caretaker client’s account must be deleted instead
. W
hen the ori
ginal invoice is 
deleted, any related debit/credit transactions are also deleted from partner accounts.

 Codes
(lower 
Codes
and 
Descript
ion
pane) defaults to all due codes. This section is

range or to exclude certain codes.

for a certain code/patient.


Check this box only
when you are actually sending out recalls

wh
ether it is via card, 
letter, e
mail or exported. Then, your recall information will be correct and valuable 
when you report on compliance rate and response.


 Recall Number
(optional): Enter a recall number to search for codes only on that round 
of recalls. For example, enter a 2 to find all patients on their second reminder.
